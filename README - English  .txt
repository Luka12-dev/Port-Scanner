How to Use Port Scanner – Complete Guide
What is a Port Scanner?
A port scanner is a powerful network tool that helps you identify open, closed, or filtered ports on a target machine or network. Each port corresponds to a specific service or application (like HTTP on port 80, FTP on port 21, etc.). By scanning ports, you get insights into what services are running and if there are any vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

Why Use a Port Scanner?
Security auditing: Find open ports to detect vulnerabilities before attackers do.

Network troubleshooting: Identify which services are active or blocked.

Penetration testing: Map network surface for authorized testing.

Educational purposes: Learn how networks and services communicate.

How to Use This Port Scanner
Launch the application.
Open the “Port Scanner.exe” tool on your computer.

Input the target address.
Enter the IP address or domain name of the machine you want to scan. Make sure you have authorization to scan that target!

Set the port range.
Specify the range of ports to scan, for example from port 1 to port 65535. Narrow ranges make the scan faster, while larger ranges are more thorough.

Start the scan.
Click the “Start Scan” button to begin. The tool will send requests to each port in the range and check their status.

View the results.
After the scan finishes, the app will display a list of ports and their status:

Open: Port is accessible and likely running a service.

Closed: Port is not accessible or blocked.

Filtered: Port might be blocked by firewall or filter.

Analyze the findings.
Use the results to understand which services are exposed and whether any ports should be secured or closed.
